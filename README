flexible cms system for the social internet club ACME.
nodejs backend, backbonejs client, jQuery ofc.

I'll put something more professional in here eventually...

some notes:
===========

* grunt build for the servable
* grunt server for the devserver


order:
------

1) main loads router
2) router loads view
3) view loads collections
4) collections use models
5) appstate model somewhere around here
